# Object Relationships Conclusion

Over the past several lessons and labs, we've seen in detail how relationships
between Ruby objects work. Always keep in mind that when we're writing programs,
we're reflecting real-world situations and environments. We can model these
associations in our code with relationship patterns such as "belongs to" and
"has many." We also looked at how classes and methods within classes can
collaboratively send messages to one another and explored how to use the concept of a
"join" class to represent more complex relationships.

Ruby object relationships will provide the foundations of the programs you write
in the future, and the more accurately you can create associations between your
program and the real-world, the more your program's users will benefit from your
work.
